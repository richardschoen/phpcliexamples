# PHP Command Line (CLI) Example Scripts
This repository houses sample PHP command line example scripts and templates. I have not found a lot of good sample CLI templates for use with PHP.    

There may be a mix of Windows, Linux and IBM i specific scripts.   

## List - All Platforms
These are PHP scripts that should work on all platforms.  
- ```phpparms1.php``` - Parse command line parameters and validate them.

## List - IBM i 
These are PHP scripts that should work with IBM i.
